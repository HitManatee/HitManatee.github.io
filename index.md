## Game Jams

Mainly worked on the soundtrack in this game.
[Neon Embrace](https://arbex.itch.io/neon-embrace)

Sound design and Graphics were my main duties, did a little scripting too.
[Lying Ads](https://biebrass.itch.io/lying-ads)

Worked on loads of scripting, made the soundtrack.
Couldn't get everything to work, but hindsight is 20/20.
